# facial_emotion_detection_using_deep_learning

This project dwells into classifying facial emotions from images using deep learning techniques. In this project, we train four compare four different deep learning models (DenseNet, MobileNet, VGG16, VGG-ResNet) and compare their perfroamcne in terms of accuracy. The performance was evaluated on the FER2013 dataset which was acquired from kaggle. The training set consisted of 28,729 images while the test set consisted of 7,178 images, each of the sets containing facial images across 7 different images.
