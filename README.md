# facial_emotion_detection_using_deep_learning

This project dwells into classifying facial emotions from images using deep learning techniques. In this project, we train four compare four different deep learning models (DenseNet, MobileNet, VGG16, VGG-ResNet) and compare their perfroamcne in terms of accuracy.
